SASTOMAHANGO PROJECT STRUCTURE
SastoMahango is a centralized market intelligence platform designed to provide the general public with accurate, daily average market prices for a wide range of items in the Nepali market.
The main goal is to bridge the information gap between market hubs and consumers. Users can instantly access the current valuation of items ranging from daily essentials to high-end tech, fostering transparency in the economy.
To ensure data accuracy, a dedicated team of Contributors updates the prices daily or weekly. However, to maintain the "Gold Standard" of trust, all updates must be validated by a Master Admin before appearing on the public site.
